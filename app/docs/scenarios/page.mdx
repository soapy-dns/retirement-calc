# Scenarios

To help compare different options, it is possible to create different scenarios.  
For example you might want 2 scenarios, where you work longer in one than the other.

**Note: details are not automatically stored. You will need to export any configuration changes to your, then re-import them if required. For security, you should only do this on a device you control.**

A scenario comprises of

- <Anchor href={documentDetails.assets.url}>Assets</Anchor>. The initial assets / income streams.
- <Anchor href={documentDetails.context.url}>Context</Anchor>. Configuration representing the environment.
- <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>Transfers</Anchor>. Declarations to transfer from one asset to another.

## Calculations

Taking the initial values and <Anchor href={documentDetails.context.url}>context</Anchor> into account, the year's income, and expenditure is calculated to determine the state of play for the next year.

This is then repeated for subsequent years.

Often it is necessary to drawdown on assets eg take money from your pension pot, or sell some shares.
Configuration of <Anchor href={documentDetails.assets.url}>assets</Anchor> is done in such a way to determine what to cash in / drawdown and when.

Ultimately the calculation won't be able to work out what to drawdown. In this case the calculation will stop.
If you want to continue you can configure <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>transfers</Anchor>
