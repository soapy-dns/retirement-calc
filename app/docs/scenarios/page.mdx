# Scenarios

To help compare different options, it is possible to create different scenarios.  
For example you might want 2 scenarios, where you work longer in one than the other.

**Note: details are not automatically stored. If you want to save for later use, you will have to export the config to your local device, then re-import later.
For security, you should only do this on a device you own.**

A scenario comprises of

- <Anchor href={documentDetails.assets.url}>Assets</Anchor>. The initial assets / income streams.
- <Anchor href={documentDetails.context.url}>Context</Anchor>. Configuration representing the environment.
- <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>Transfers</Anchor>. Declarations to transfer from one asset to another.

Scenarios can be edited and removed. To add a new scenario, an existing scenario must be duplicated.
This is easier than adding from scratch, and explains why it is not possible to remove the last remaining scenario.

The scenario as a whole is taken to calculate expected future results. (See <Anchor href={documentDetails.calculations.url}>Calculations</Anchor> for more details.)
