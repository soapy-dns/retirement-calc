# Assets

There are 2 types of Asset

- Capital assets
- Income assets

## Capital Assets

These are things that hold value.

- Cash
- Properties
- Penions - Defined contribution / money purchase
- Shares

## Income Assets

These are things which provide an income stream.

- Salary
- Pensions - Defined benefit / final salary

Assets cannot be removed if there is a transfer to or from the asset. The transfer must be removed first.

## Drawdowns

Some capital assets can be automatically drawndown.
The order this is done will be controlled by the drawdown order of the asset.

Properties cannot be automatically drawn down.

If you want to make that capital available, then set up a <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>Transfer</Anchor>.

## Cash

E.g. Bank accounts, money under the bed, term deposits. These assets are low risk, and there returns are lower.
