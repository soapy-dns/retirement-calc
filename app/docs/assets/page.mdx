# Assets

There are 2 types of Asset

- Capital assets
- Income assets

## Capital Assets

These are things that hold value.

- Cash
- Properties
- Penions - Defined contribution / money purchase
- Shares

## Income Assets

These are things which provide an income stream.

- Salary
- Pensions - Defined benefit / final salary

Assets cannot be removed if there is a transfer to or from the asset. The transfer must be removed first.

## Drawdowns

Some capital assets can be automatically drawndown.
The order this is done will be controlled by the drawdown order of the asset.

Properties cannot be automatically drawn down.

If you want to make that capital available, then set up a <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>Transfer</Anchor>.

## Cash

E.g. Bank accounts, money under the bed, term deposits. These assets are low risk, and there returns are lower.

## Property

This property that you own as your own home, or as an investment property.
It is not commercial property, or any type of property funds.  
If a rental property is sold in a year, then rental income will be assumed for half the year only.

## Super

Super contributions and investment earnings are taxed in Australia at a rate of {taxConfig.superTax.AU.superIncomeTaxPercent}% (2024).
This is taken into account within the calculations.
