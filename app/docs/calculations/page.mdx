# Calculations

Taking the initial values and <Anchor href={documentDetails.context.url}>context</Anchor> into account,
the year's income, expenditure, drawdowns, transfers and taxes are calculated to
determine the state of play for the next year.

This is then repeated for subsequent years.

## Income

Income from assets apart from super, is accumulated and moved to the asset which is the 'income bucket'.

## Expenses

Expenses are calculated as the sum of living expenses, and taxes.

## Drawdowns

If expenses are bigger than income, then it will be necessary to drawdown on assets capital.
e.g. take money from your pension pot, or sell some shares.

We can automate this (to some extent), by the simple strategy of marking the order in which assets can be drawn down.

For example we might want to drawdown on cash first (it is possible to set a minimum level for the asset),
then super, then shares. Some assets may not be draw downable until a certain year - eg super assets.

It is possible that some assets while drawdownable will have the drawdownable amount taxed. This is true for UK pensions.
This means there will be more expenses so more drawdowns will be required.  
This could almost go on forever, but will stop if less than a certain amount (eg 100),
and this will be noted as a negative surplus.

It is not possible to automatically drawdown on properties.

Other strategies may be available in the future.

Configuration of the drawdown order is done in the <Anchor href={documentDetails.assets.url}>assets</Anchor> config.

Ultimately the calculation won't be able to work out what to drawdown.
In this case the calculations will stop.
If you want to continue you may be able configure <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>transfers</Anchor>, eg the sale of a property.
Note:- if you do sell a property and you then need to rent, your living expenses may go up.

## Transfers

When a <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>transfers</Anchor> is set for example from asset A to asset B,
then interest will be calculated for half the year on asset A and half the year on asset B.

## Taxes

Income tax, and any earnings tax (e.g. National Insurance in the UK) are automatically calculated using individuals allowances.  
Income tax bands are assumed to increase in line with inflation, although governments often don't do this (fiscal drag) as it increases there tax income.

_Notes:_

1. Capital gains taxes are not yet calculated.
   {/* 2. Tax rates are correct as at {config.asAt} */}
