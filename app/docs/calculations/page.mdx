# Calculations

Taking the initial values and <Anchor href={documentDetails.context.url}>context</Anchor> into account, the year's income, expenditure, and any taxes are calculated to determine the state of play for the next year.

This is then repeated for subsequent years.

Often it is necessary to drawdown on assets eg take money from your pension pot, or sell some shares.
Configuration of <Anchor href={documentDetails.assets.url}>assets</Anchor> is done in such a way to determine what to cash in / drawdown and when.

Ultimately the calculation won't be able to work out what to drawdown. In this case the calculation will stop.
If you want to continue you can configure <Anchor href={documentDetails.transfers.url}>transfers</Anchor>
