Income taxes and any earnings taxes (eg National Insurance in the UK) are automatically calculated, so it is necessary to know your country of residence to calculate the correct amount.

Capital gains taxes are not calculated. If you really need capital gains taxes, you'd need to enter a 'Transfer' with the manually calculated capital gains tax included in the costs associated with the transfer.

If the tax residence country is different from the country of the currency being used then an exchange rate will need to be entered.
