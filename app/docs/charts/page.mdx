A visual view of how your assets increase (if you are lucky!) or decrease over time, as well as a year by year view of your income and asset drawdowns.  
This will continue for a maximum of 50 years (by which age you are probably dead) or when no more assets can be automatically drawn down eg a property.
If this is the case, you might consider adding some transfers e.g. the selling of a property.

On a mobile device you might consider holding the landscape mode (and refresh the page because it doesn't seem to auto re-size StylePropertyMapReadOnly.)
