# About this calculator

This calculater will calculate the value of your assets going forward until there are none left or manual intervention is required.

It is work in progress, and was designed to help _me_ to prepare financially for retirement.

No identifiable data is captured, and no data is stored. It is possible to export and re-import any configuration you build to your local device for later use.

The calculations will currently work only for Australian or Scottish residents since taxes are taken into account.

_**No guarantee is given that the calculations are correct.**_
