# About this calculator

This calculater will calculate the value of your assets going forward until there are none left or manual intervention is required.

It is work in progress, and was designed to help _**me**_ to prepare financially for retirement.

No identifiable data is captured, or stored on the cloud, although it is possible to save and restore any configuration you build for later use.

The calculations will currently work only for Australian or Scottish residents since it takes taxes into account.

_No guarantee is given that the calculations are correct._
