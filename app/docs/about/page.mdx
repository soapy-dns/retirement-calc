# About this calculator

This calculater will calculate the value of your assets going forward until there are none left or manual intervention is required.

It is work in progress, and was designed to help _me_ understand my retirement finances.

No identifiable data is captured, and no data is stored. It is possible to export and re-import any configuration you build to your computer or laptop for later use - _Obviously don't do this on a shared._

The calculations will currently work only for Australian or Scottish residents as any relevant income taxes are calculated.

_**No guarantee is given that the calculations are correct.**_
