# About this calculator

This calculater will try to project your spending, income and the value of your assets into the future.

It will stop when there are no assets left, or manual intervention is required.

It is work in progress, and was designed to help _me_ understand my retirement finances.

## Features

- No identifiable data is captured, and no data is stored.
- Allows different scenarios to be compared.
- No tracking is done.
- Shows results either as a graph or as a spreadsheet.
- Works for residents of Australia and the UK with assets / income in either or both countries.
- It is possible to export and re-import any scenarios to your computer for later use - _Don't do this on a shared computer!_

The calculations will currently work only for Australian or UK residents as any relevant income taxes are calculated.

_**No guarantee is given that the calculations are correct.**_
