This is an estimate of the on going inflation rate.

A reasonable long term estimate could be about 2.5%. However, there are often fluctuations.

In order to &apos;future proof&apos; your retirement, you may want to consider a higher inflation rate at the
beginning of your retirement, slowly moving towards the mean. This is because a higher inflation rate at the
beginning of the term could have a long term negative impact. It&apos;s up to you! You can play about with
different rates to see the affect of each.
