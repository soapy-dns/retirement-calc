This section allows you to configure your calculations for the projected values of your assets in subsequent
years.
There are 3 parts.

- _Context_ the environment the calculations take place in. e.g. the inflation rate.
- _Assets_ The assets at the start of the period. This allows each asset value to be calculated for subsequent years.
- _Transfers_ Any transfers which should be configured to take place. Note that some assets can be
  automatically transfered depending on the asset configuration.
