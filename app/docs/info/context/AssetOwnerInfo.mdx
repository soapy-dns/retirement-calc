I have assumed there are up to 2 asset owners. If there is only 1, then only assign assets to that one.

If there are 2 owners each will have there own tax thresholds, so results will be more accurate if you mark who owns which asset.

It is optional to include the year of birth for an owner, however if it isn't entered, the age of the owner will be assumed to be 65
at the start of the simulation. This will affect the tax calculations, and may returns results that are not as accurate.
