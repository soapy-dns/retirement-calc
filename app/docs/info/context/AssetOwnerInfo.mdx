I have assumed there are up to 2 asset owners. If there is only 1, then only assign assets to that one.

If there are 2 owners each will have there own tax thresholds, so results will be more accurate if you mark who owns which asset.

The year of birth, and gender of an owner are unfortunately required to ensure accurate calculations and life expectancy.
