Bricks and mortar.
More than likely this is just the family home, but it could be rental properties.
If it is a rental property, I am currently allowing only 1 rental period.

It is not for commercial properties or funds investing in commercial properties.

A rate of growth may be 3%. This is less than shares, and should be a lower risk asset.

It is not possible to mark these assets for automatic drawdown.
