This is an estimate of your future living expenses in today's money.

To estimate this, a good place to start is to use your expenses over the previous year, and assume that
you&apos;ll spend the same going forward. Living expenses are always assumed to increase with inflation -
because they will.

Many retirees spend more money at the beginning of retirement, and less in later years when they may be less
active. The &apos;standard&apos; seems to be to lower your expenses at age 75, but you can configure your
future expenses as and how you wish.
