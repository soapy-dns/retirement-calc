# The Retirement Project

WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

It has kind of evolved, and isn't exactly refined or clean.

The calculation api format is a mess.

This is my 1st Nextjs app

Uses multiple icons libs and sometimes multiple ways of doing the same thing as I play about.

jest and react testing library for unit tests

cypress for end to end tests

mdx for application documentation.

## Glossary

- Income Can come from salary, interest, dividends etc
- Earnings Comes from salary only. In UK, earnings are subject to National Insurance

## Application Documentation

Application documentation uses MDX. We do not use the remote version of MDX as the non-remote version doesn't need frontmatter, we can make use of the file structure, and it integrates better with existing components.
